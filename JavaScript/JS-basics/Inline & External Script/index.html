<!--Difference b/w Inline & external script.

There are 2 ways to add JS to a Website, 

    html file will open up right in the browser,
    First :- Inline Script, 

To see results, open up JS developer console. 

Now we define the source attribute, src="script.js'
All we have to do is to add an external script to a website like this.-->

    <script> console.log('Hello World');</script>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</html>


<!--Its always best to have to code in an external file code in it.

Advtange of the inline script is that we don't have to load an additional file. 

But its still better to have everything in an external file, because it allows us to nicely keep the html & the JS separated in different files.-->
