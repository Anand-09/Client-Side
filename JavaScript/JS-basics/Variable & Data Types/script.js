/* ***** Truthy and Falsy values and Equality operators *****

*** Falsy values :- 

- Falsy value is a value that is considered false when evaluated in an If Else statement condition.

And the values that are Falsy in JS are :-

undefined,
null,
0,
''; Empty strings & 
NaN : not a number

All of these 5 different values here will be converted to False when evaluated in a True False condition.

That's why we call them falsy,

They are not exactly false but they'll be turn out to be False when evaluated in a If Else condition.

*** Truthy values :-

- All the values which are True when evaluated in an IF Else statement condition.

So, basically

its all the values that are not Falsy.

NOT falsy values

// truthy values : NOT falsy values
// truthy values : undefined, null, 0, '', NaN
